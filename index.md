## About Me

Hi, I am an incoming M.S. student at the KAIST School of Computing, advised by Alice Oh. 

My current research interests include LLM reasoning (RLVR), AI creativity, and open-endedness. I also closely collaborate with [Andrea Zanette](https://azanette.com/) for projects related to LLM reasoning and self-improvement. I have finished my undergraduate at KAIST when I worked on evaluation, multilinguality, and cultural NLP.

A (partially) maintained CV of mine can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmBlSpN3PfOCr4rOwJWPg8lZisJHGYy0PhR2ARucJmc/edit).

I am really open to meeting and chatting with new people. Feel free to schedule an [online meeting](https://calendly.com/sheikhshafayat2/30min) if you want to chat about something (any paper, potential collaboration, a cool novel, or just about anything). If you are in Seoul and Daejeon, shoot me an email to grab a coffee or go climbing together!

On my free time, I enjoy bouldering, running, playing chess (still a beginner), or basking in the sunset with a novel.

## Current Readings 

Here are the three latest books that I am reading/just finished. I would be very grateful to receive book recommendations from anyone!
- **Convenience Store Woman (Sayaka Murata):** A woman working at a convenience store for 18 years feels herself to be a part of it. A beautiful novela on societal expectation, womanhood and abnormality. 
- **Nexus (Yuval Noah Harari):** I enjoy Harari's writings â€” Sapiens being still one of my all time favorites. Nexus is a fascinating exploration on the nature of human collaboration and information networks (I am still in the beginning stage; so I might update this after finishing the book). 
- **Never Let Me Go (Kazuo Ishiguro):** I just started this book, of which I heard a lot from a lot of people. Would update this once I am done.
