## About Me

Hi, I am an undergraduate student at KAIST, majoring in Computer Science. Alongside enjoying delicious 닭갈비 (dak-kalbi) and 부대찌개 (budae jjigae), I conduct research related to LLM reasoning, factuality and knowledge representation under Professor Alice Oh.

I also collaborate with LK Lab of Minjoon Seo as an external collaborator on projects regarding multilingual NLP. Along this line, I also spend some time building benchmark datasets for low resource languages.

Previously, I worked under Professor Hyunjung Shim in CVML, exploring the use of synthetic data to make convolutional neural networks robust to noise, perturbations, and long-tail shift.

I am really open to meeting and chatting with new people about life, technology, research, literature, and everything in between. Feel free to reach out to me, and we can grab a coffee sometime in Seoul or Daejeon!

A (partially) maintained CV of mine can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmBlSpN3PfOCr4rOwJWPg8lZisJHGYy0PhR2ARucJmc/edit).
