  Hi, I am an undergraduate student at KAIST, majoring in Computer Science. Alongside enjoying delicious dak-kalbi and budae jjigae, I conduct research related to NLP reasoning for low-resource languages under Professor [Alice Oh](https://aliceoh9.github.io/). I am also interested in LLM factuality and how factual knowledge is represented in LLMs.

  I collaborate with LK Lab of [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/) as an external collaborator on projects regarding multilingual NLP.

  Previously, I worked under Professor Hyunjung Shim in [CVML](https://sites.google.com/view/cvml-kaist), exploring the use of synthetic data to make convolutional neural networks robust to noise, perturbations, and long-tail shift.

  I am really open to meeting and chatting with new people about life, technology, research, literature, and everything in between. Feel free to reach out to me, and we can grab a coffee sometime in Seoul or Daejeon!

  If you are looking for the training materials I curated for the Bangladesh Physics Olympiad, please refer to [here](https://smartiansofscience.org/pho-materials/) (Oops! I found that the site is down for now).

  A (partially) maintained CV of mine can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmBlSpN3PfOCr4rOwJWPg8lZisJHGYy0PhR2ARucJmc/edit?usp=sharing).

      Since I couldn't find many good things to write about myself, here goes the list of some people whose work/life ethos I deeply admire. I have never met any of them and none of them knows me, yet, I look up to them whenever I need inspiration!
      - [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/): She has a super intuitive understanding about how the tech world works, and she knows how to communicate what she knows. Also, definitely check out her reading list!
      - [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://fchollet.com/): The famed Google researcher and philosopher who has very important insights and opinions on AGI
      - [Michael Chang](http://mbchang.github.io/): Check out his reading list!
      - [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/): Andrej needs no introduction. Only if I could explain things as good as he does! His [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) is a goldmine for learning to code things up from scratch!
